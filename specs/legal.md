* ALTA X GEN2 is not a toy and should be operated with extreme care, as improper operation can cause damage to property, serious personal injury or death.&#x20;
* As with any multi-rotor aircraft, ALTA X GEN2 is a complex and technical machine. Novice pilots should invest sufficient time on a flight simulator and seek training from an experienced pilot prior to operation. The ALTA X GEN2 Aircraft Flight Manual and a flight simulator are no substitute for training with an experienced pilot, particularly when it comes to learning how to safely operate ALTA X GEN2. Novice pilots should never fly without the supervision of an experienced pilot.&#x20;
* Always check ALTA X GEN2 and its components prior to operation.&#x20;
* Always maintain a safe distance from ALTA X GEN2 when in use.&#x20;

* Only use propellers supplied by Freefly Systems that are designed for use on ALTA X GEN2.&#x20;
* Always remove the propellers or power ALTA X GEN2 using a low power source when making a change to the configuration of ALTA X GEN2 to prevent propeller strikes in the event of unintentional motor starts.&#x20;
* Always test ALTA X GEN2 with the propellers removed to make sure that the motors are spinning in the correct direction and that the motor assignment is correct with respect to the Autopilot flight controller. If you have either of these wrong, the ALTA X GEN2 will be uncontrollable and dangerous.
* It is your responsibility to perform a full system check of ALTA X GEN2 prior to every flight.&#x20;
* It is your responsibility to learn how to safely operate ALTA X GEN2 and to adhere to all applicable rules and regulations.&#x20;
* Fly at your own risk.&#x20;
