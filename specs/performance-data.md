# Performance Data

## Flight Time

Our flight tests for the Alta X Gen2 were conducted by running the batteries from 100% down to 0%. While this is not typical in real-world operations—where a pilot would usually land with some remaining battery for safety—it provides a clear baseline for comparing performance between airframes and payloads. Furthermore, hovering draws more power than flying forward at a moderate speed. Because most real flights involve some forward motion (rather than continuous hovering), these 100%–0% hover results end up being a fair representation of typical flights that land with higher battery reserves.&#x20;
