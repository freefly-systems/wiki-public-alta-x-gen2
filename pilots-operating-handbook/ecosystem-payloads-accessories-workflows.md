# Ecosystem / Payloads / Accessories / Workflows

The [**Pilot's Operating Handbook**](/broken/pages/S2Ubs4iM85ywighYen7z) covers how to operate Alta X Gen2 itself: setup, flight modes, procedures, and emergencies.

**For everything else, see our Freefly Drone** [**Ecosystem Wiki**](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-LYU75KLzw4BcaiMGVz2/s/WXREyAKYAeQJ4gfg2SPg/)**. Payloads, accessories, workflow guides, and software integrations are shared resources that work across Freefly aircraft.**
